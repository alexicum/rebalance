###Components
  Spent time selecting components.

  At first `Material-UI` were installed, but because of their complexity and lack of ComboBox took `React.Semantic-UI`.

###
- used functional setState: setState((state, props) => {})
- wrote stateUtils - functions helping in component state control:
  - UI state (errors, touched controls)
  - fields values of the form
